            </h2>
            <p class="md:text-lg text-gray-700">I believe you are reading this because some kind of health issue is
                troubling you, which conventional ways or even other alternative methods have not been able to resolve
                or
                even help. I can definitely understand how that feels, because I used to be where you are as well.
                <br><br>
                Chinese Medicine was largely under my radar in terms of what I initially had in mind as a career choice.
                I
                had wanted to study conventional Western Allopathic Medicine to become a traditional Medical Doctor(MD);
                this was in my university years while at Simon Fraser University, where my strong foundation in the core
                sciences was proof of this goal. But at the same time, I had a range of health issues that were largely
                unresolved through the conventional drug route. In fact I actually never liked drugs and medication. In
                retrospect I believe I already had the holistic medicine mindset somewhere deep inside me that I never
                really paid attention to.
                <br><br>
                Different people choose different career paths for different reasons. I am an individual who likes to
                delve
                into the deeper aspect of things; the 'root' of things if you will, the sort of 'why' behind worldly
                phenomena. Because my health has never been the best and caused trouble for me from time to time, one
                can
                say there was unresolved frustration. My decision to pursue a health-related career stems from this
                fact.
                Ironically modern medicine cannot explain the good majority of the diseases and medical problems that
                are
                out there. Treatment is also often limited to symptomatic relief, which I, until becoming a Chinese
                Medicine
                Doctor, did not realize wasn't even that effective; in fact it was mostly ineffective to be honest. I
                thought it didn't help me because I was maybe a bit special, but this fact became more apparent as I
                started
                to practice and hear more from what patients have to say.
                <br><br>
                Family members had suggested that I should consider Chinese Medicine. I did not fully agree to this at
                first
                but in my spare time had eventually started to read up on Chinese Medicine texts just to get a feel of
                what
                this is about; this instead raised a lot of questions that my modern scientific mindset could not grasp
                at
                the time---I had never thought it to be so confusing. At one particular occasion, I went for a treatment
                by
                a practitioner recommended by my family members. His answers to many of my prodding questions showed me
                that
                this medicine was not 'confusing', but rather 'complex', and could contain the answers to the truth I
                was
                looking for behind my own health challenges. Chinese Medicine provided a framework that to me was
                unbelievably impressive. After some consideration, I eventually decided to study Chinese Medicine
                professionally. Years go by quickly after this.
                <br><br>
                Through the years of seeing patients, I am still studying and continuously learning. But my health has
                completely turned around for the better. I have personally used Chinese Medicine to drastically turn
                around
                my body and resolve many of the health problems that were constantly challenging me in the past. It has
                also
                enabled me to learn how to properly take care of myself as well as that of my family members and
                patients so
                that they can stay healthy for long time to come. I for one have not seen the conventional Medical
                Doctor
                for as long as I can remember. With this medicine I was able to take health into my own hands, both for
                preventive and treatment purposes.
                <br><br>
                If you are still thinking if Chinese Medicine and acupuncture is right for you, it is not in your
                interest
                to ponder any further. When it comes to holistic and alternative medicine for chronic issues, the fact
                of
                the matter is that there are very few choices available if you are looking for a system that has a
                time-tested tradition, systematic maturity equivalent to modern medicine and the number of clinical
                trials
                and people to back it up. I know this from personal experience. I use it every day to treat problems of
                all
                sorts and this great holistic approach really helps many people. I believe it can do the same for you
                too if
                you are willing to invest in your own health today.
